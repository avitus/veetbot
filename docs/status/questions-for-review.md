# Decisions taken without review

Andy is away from 2026-07-24 for roughly 72 hours, with the instruction to
continue the plan to the point where coding can begin, to make an intelligent
decision at each obstacle rather than stopping, and to record every one of those
decisions for review.

This file is that record. Each entry states what was decided, why, what the
alternative was, and what it costs to reverse. Nothing here is settled; every
item is open for a different answer.

The reversal cost is the only column that should drive urgency. Items marked
**cheap** are prose changes. Items marked **moderate** touch a migration or a
schema that has not been written yet, so they are cheap now and expensive after
Milestone 2 ships. Items marked **expensive** would require rewriting a
committed spec and its dependents.

## Process and environment

### The plan is committed but not pushed

**Decided:** work happens on a branch, `docs/plan-completion`, cut from `main`
at `dba12a5`. Commits are made at each module boundary with the identity
`Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`, passed per-command so the global git config is
untouched.

**Why:** the push cannot be performed from here. The bridge to the local machine
has no network access — SSH to `github.com:22` is refused at the proxy — and the
cloud container that does have network has no write credential for the
repository. Committing locally preserves the work in git with real history
rather than leaving it as uncommitted working-tree changes.

**Action required on return:** review the branch, then run one `git push -u
origin docs/plan-completion`. Everything else is done.

**Reversal cost:** none. The branch can be rebased, squashed, or discarded.

### Module order was chosen by accumulated dependency debt

**Decided:** the specs are written in the order event log and persistence,
policy and approvals, model gateway and adapters, tool system and MCP,
evaluation harness, runtime loop — not in milestone order.

**Why:** each of those is depended upon by specs already written. The context
engine (ADR-0020) assumes a `policy_version` that nothing yet defines; the
memory specs assume projections that rebuild. Writing the depended-upon layers
first means the existing specs get validated against them rather than drifting.

**Note:** the plan's own rule that evaluations are built before advanced
features argues for pulling the evaluation harness earlier than fifth. It was
kept at fifth because the harness needs the four specs above it to know what it
is gating. This is worth a second opinion.

**Reversal cost:** cheap, and mostly moot once all six exist.

## Event log and persistence (ADR-0003, ADR-0004)

### `payload_schema_version` is added to the `events` table

**Decided:** the column is added in the first migration, `SMALLINT NOT NULL`,
even though nothing reads it until the first schema change.

**Why:** Section 6.8 and the Milestone 2 acceptance list both require payload
versioning; Section 15's table omits the column. It is one column now and an
unmigratable retrofit once a production log exists, because there is no correct
value to backfill for events written before versioning.

**Alternative:** add it when the first event shape changes.

**Reversal cost:** moderate — trivial before Milestone 2, effectively impossible
after.

### One appender per session is treated as load-bearing for correctness

**Decided:** Section 27.5's "one active run per session" default is kept as
written, but ADR-0003 records that projection correctness now depends on it, and
the `runs` table enforces it with a partial unique index.

**Why:** a monotonic sequence watermark is only safe if writes to a session are
serialized. With concurrent appenders, a projection can advance past a sequence
whose transaction has not committed and never see it — the log stays consistent
and the loss reproduces identically on every rebuild.

**The question:** should Section 27.5's *default* be promoted to an
*invariant*? Making it an invariant closes the hazard permanently but forecloses
concurrent runs per session, which may matter for multi-device use (ADR-0011).

**Interim position:** keep the wording, document the coupling, and specify the
companion change — snapshot-aware watermarking with
`pg_snapshot_xmin(pg_current_snapshot())` — that must land in the same commit if
the default is ever relaxed.

**Reversal cost:** cheap as prose; moderate if relaxed after projections exist,
since every projection's cursor logic changes at once.

### No outbox table

**Decided:** event publication uses `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` with no outbox, and every
consumer polls from a watermark.

**Why:** `NOTIFY` is transactional — delivered on commit, discarded on rollback
— so the atomicity an outbox provides is already present. What `NOTIFY` does not
provide is delivery, and a watermark poll covers that more cheaply than a second
table with its own drainer.

**Alternative:** a standard transactional outbox.

**Reversal cost:** cheap. Adding an outbox later is additive; consumers that
already poll keep working.

### Three priority classes, capacity reserved rather than aged

**Decided:** interactive (0), async (10), maintenance (20), with worker slots
reserved per class.

**Why:** the revision summary requires claim-priority ordering and Section 14's
body has none. Reserved capacity was chosen over aging because aging makes a
run's latency a function of the queue's history, which cannot be reconstructed
from a single run's record when explaining an incident.

**Alternative:** strict priority with aging, or separate queues per class.

**Reversal cost:** cheap. `priority` is a `SMALLINT`, so classes can subdivide
without a migration, and the scheduling policy is worker-side configuration.

### `max_attempts` is 3, and `runs.failure` is the dead letter

**Decided:** only lease expiry requeues a run; permanent Section 13
classifications fail immediately; there is no separate dead-letter table.

**Why:** the plan specifies no queue-level retry semantics at all, so some
number had to be chosen. Three is conventional and low enough that a
systematically failing run does not consume a worker for long. Keeping failures
in `runs` keeps them attached to their own events and checkpoints.

**Alternative:** a configurable per-priority-class attempt cap.

**Reversal cost:** cheap — it is a constant and a status value.

### Trajectory export is split across Milestone 2 and Milestone 3

**Decided:** the projection scaffold and its watermark are built in Milestone 2;
the export itself is Milestone 3.

**Why:** the plan contradicts itself. Section 21's Milestone 2 Implement list
says "Trajectory-export projection scaffold"; Section 21.1's sequencing table
places trajectory export in Milestone 3. Both readings are satisfied by the
split, and the scaffold is a second consumer that exercises the watermark
machinery early, which is worth having.

**The question:** which of the two statements in the plan is the intended one?
The other should be corrected so the document stops disagreeing with itself.

**Reversal cost:** cheap.

### Ambiguous non-idempotent tool executions are reported as `UNCERTAIN`

**Decided:** a tool left `RUNNING` by a crash, whose idempotency class does not
permit a safe retry, resolves to `UNCERTAIN` and is reported to the model as an
unknown outcome rather than as a failure.

**Why:** "it failed" is a claim the runtime cannot support about a payment that
may have been made. Models handle stated uncertainty better than they handle a
confident falsehood, and the alternative invites a retry of an operation that may
already have succeeded.

**Alternative:** report as failed, or block the run for human review.

**Reversal cost:** moderate. It is a tool-protocol outcome value, so changing it
later means changing every tool contract and the prompt text that explains it.
